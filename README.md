# Movella Lightsaber

A very quick & dirty app that connects via bluetooth to a Movella sensor.

When moving the sensor with enough velocity, the sound of a lightsaber is played by the app.

## Quality

Terrible code-quality as I've never learnt Kotlin before. However, functional (except the myriads of bugs).
